On this earth, we're building sandcastles with our Father in heaven.

We may create beautiful sculptures, fortresses, and designs, but in a moment, a wave may come and sweep it all away. However, the real joy comes from the time spent with the Father and the relationship that is built with Him, because no wave can ever wash that relationship away.

In life, we often chase after sandcastles instead of focusing on the true joy, which remains constant despite the winds and waves of life. These writings aim to point us back to Him.

Genesis 15:1b _"I am your shield, your very great reward."_
