On this earth we're buidling SandCastles with our Father in heaven.

We may build beautiful scultpures, fortresses and designs but in a moment a wave may come and sweep it all away. But the real joy comes from time spent with the Father and the realtionship that is buidlt with him because no wave will ever wash that relationship away.

In life we often chase after sandcastles instead of focusing on the real joy, which is constant depsite the wind and waves of life. These writings aim to point us back to Him.

Gensis 15:1b _"I am your shield, your very great reward."_
